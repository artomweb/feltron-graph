## my dataset

`data.csv` contains the songs I listened to for a few months, with their timestamp

I think it's funny how similar the actual shape of the graphs are, as I think this suggests the act of aggregating any natural behaviour per hour over a long time would create a similar graph. Such as when you pick up your phone, when you stand up, when you drink water, etc...
